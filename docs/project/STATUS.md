# Kajo Current Status

Last updated: **2026-09-12**
Current milestone: **MVP 0.1 — first public Kajo**
Current sprint: **Sprint 014 — algorithm reliability / real catalog / portable engine**
Last accepted sprint: **Sprint 013 — Prediction Nervous System & ScenarioMemory**

This file owns one exact resumable next task. [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) owns order,
[MVP](../product/MVP.md) owns release blockers and [LAUNCH_LOOP](../product/LAUNCH_LOOP.md)
owns the Taste/Friend/Shared flow. Read current main first, then the active branch;
an older branch-local handoff cannot replace newer accepted product decisions.

## Current source packet — E1 #235

The owner reported the protocol-2 device tests working on 2026-09-12, with one
remaining UI defect: **Yritä uudelleen** stays visible after connectivity returns.
They requested that recovery correction and the other application UI ideas in a
later pre-MVP UI packet, and asked development to continue.

**The explicitly selected independent source packet is now [E1 #235](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/235),
branch `feat/235-portable-engine-contracts`.** Follow that branch's current STATUS
for executable generic contracts and Kajo/media plus synthetic non-media fixtures.
It starts from accepted main and does not absorb or accept #229 runtime changes.
The ordered continuation is E1 contract acceptance → D1 #236 → D2 #237. No public
dataset download or runtime scorer replacement is part of E1.

## Native packet checkpoint — #228 / draft PR #229

`feat/228-delivered-origin` remains the native source/rollout record. CI #468 and
manual [CI #469](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/actions/runs/34701247895) passed
at `900dc2653e428bb1cbd27e4bdaa7ea0141e47b31`. The manual run produced
`kajo-android-standalone-900dc2653e428bb1cbd27e4bdaa7ea0141e47b31`
(artifact `10300513895`). The owner report follows this requested build;
the installed binary checksum was not independently supplied.

Owner feedback accepts the exercised normal flows, Profile switching, expired
cursor → fresh search and the reported persistence/restart checks. Record this
as device feedback, not proof of every server attribution/native callback race.
The remaining reconnect defect is [#240](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/240)
/ MVP-UX-003: recover the same failed request on usable reconnection and remove
stale retry UI after successful recovery. Do not merely hide a failed backend
response because the device says online. The owner explicitly defers this to the
next application UI packet; do not silently start it instead of E1.

The six approved server forwards remain installed through
`20260912134224_atomic_prediction_pages`. Do not deploy them again or repeat the
approval. The 15-second client deadline, exact retry/cancel semantics and all
439 local tests remain recorded in [the recovery checkpoint](sprints/SPRINT-014.md#bounded-client-recovery--2026-09-12).
No fresh-account test/reset, new DDL, automatic promotion or full DATA/ALG closure
is implied. Keep #229 draft while its named acceptance gaps remain; E1 is an
independent source packet, not a way to mark those gaps complete.

## Owner UI decisions — required before MVP

ROADMAP Phase 17.0 now requires private category statistics/progress and weekly
tracking (#230 / MVP-UX-004), grid multi-selection and List/history operations
(#231 / MVP-UX-005), plus the new card controls (#239 / MVP-UX-006). The star saves
to the existing default List shown as **Tykätyt**; the header's three-dot menu opens
other destinations. Slider and **Ei kiinnosta / Seuraava** sit at the bottom of the
card above the dock, leaving space for a description. Saving stays on the card;
**Seuraava** explicitly advances. UX_PRINCIPLES owns this planned successor to
current auto-advance, with unchanged evidence and Shared consent semantics.
Community comparisons remain conditional. Implementation is planned, not shipped.

## Accepted source, active branch and recorded hosted state

Accepted runtime source at audit start: `6dd1fec` / PR #227 — atomic/durable Item,
List and Shared action foundations. #227 is merged; do not repeat its deployment.
The #233/#234 delivery publishes independent-engine direction and reconciled
product/handoff documentation, plus bounded repository hygiene. It does not
accept #229 runtime, implement a portable engine or train a model.

#229 contains later source work: delivered-slate identity, durable exposure,
multi-List/collection UX, history projection, late outcomes, frozen replay,
eligibility-first admission, identified first pages, private source windows and
protocol-2 atomic continuation and the captured-scope mobile reader.
The branch has source/test/rollout evidence that must remain intact. Its detailed
device and implementation records stay on that branch/PR until accepted; compact
canonical successor contracts in main are explicitly labeled.

Approved hosted rollout on 2026-09-12 completed on Kajo `mwrnvfosrzwygrunrltm`,
PostgreSQL 17.6. Tracking now has **56** version/name rows, **150** public/private
functions and **37** application tables. All prior 50 history rows, 138 function
identities/owners/ACLs and 25 application/Auth-user triggers are preserved. The
new immutable-page-context trigger brings the trigger count to 26. Seven event
triggers and 24 creator-default entries are unchanged. All old table fingerprints
match after accounting for the one reviewed shadow-count constraint; the four
new private tables have RLS and deny direct reads to API roles. Anonymous and
missing-actor page calls reject with `42501` in a read-only rolled-back probe.
No application/Auth rows or row-derived counts/hashes were exported. Populated
data preservation is independently tested in isolation, not inferred from a live
row comparison. No reset, historical repair or global-default migration ran.
The installed files are now aligned with the actual provider versions:

1. `20260912133402_late_outcome_attribution.sql`
2. `20260912133832_frozen_prediction_replay.sql`
3. `20260912133941_eligibility_first_candidate_pool.sql`
4. `20260912134056_identified_prediction_page.sql`
5. `20260912134141_prediction_continuation_windows.sql`
6. `20260912134224_atomic_prediction_pages.sql`

These SQL bytes are immutable. Use a new reviewed forward for any later change;
never run whole historical `db push` or reset to reconcile main and hosted.
The separately deferred privilege-default forward
`20260909131913_close_postgres_function_defaults.sql` remains a separate gate.

The private window bounds remain 50 candidates/seen IDs, 2 MiB, fifteen minutes
from source ranking and sixteen windows per actor/Profile. Preserve receipts,
runs and Events when reclaiming expired derived cache.

## Independent engine and when public data enters

Canonical design: [PREDICTIVE_MEMORY_ENGINE](../architecture/PREDICTIVE_MEMORY_ENGINE.md),
[DATA_ENRICHMENT](../architecture/DATA_ENRICHMENT.md) and
[ADR-0008](../architecture/decisions/0008-portable-predictive-memory-engine-and-external-priors.md).
All 51 supplied conceptual sections are preserved. The core is independent; Kajo
is its first DomainAdapter.

The ordered engine work is:

| Packet | Exact deliverable | Starts after |
|---|---|---|
| [E1 #235](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/235) | Runnable generic contracts + Kajo/media and synthetic non-media fixtures; workspace/exports/root CI integration | Accepted design; default follows current #229 packet |
| [D1 #236](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/236) | Isolated manifest, MovieLens adapter and actual reproducible small real-data cohort | E1 contract acceptance |
| [D2 #237](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/237) | Train-only temporal/cold-start baselines and bounded static-state vs trajectory experiment/report | D1 normalized data |
| D3 / D4 / D5 | Optional Tag Genome / Beliefs / KuaiRand studies | D2 plus each source's own manifest/rights/task; independent of each other |
| E2 | One admitted component behind existing serving boundary | Relevant native 14.1/14.2 gates + rights/quality/compatibility/fallback/rollback |

E1/D1/D2 can run as a separately selected isolated source/research packet while
native rollout/device gates wait. Record the switch here first; their availability
does not make the default #229 continuation ambiguous. No large native user
population, production schema or separate network service is needed for D1.

Use ignored `research-data/` and `research-artifacts/` or equivalent controlled
storage. External ratings are source-typed observations, not fake native Events
or fully observed behavioral Scenarios. Public catalog enrichment and a real
user's authorized history import remain separate pipelines. Data download,
normalization, model training, evaluation and artifact admission are distinct
recorded operations. A losing challenger is a valid report; it cannot waive
native usefulness gates or deploy itself.

E1 is the selected executable-contract source work; no dataset ingestion, trained representation, world model,
multistep dreamer or automatic promotion is delivered by this audit.

## Preserved owner requirements and release order

- #232 is mandatory first-release Shared rating/rewatch behavior: Phase14 supplies
  participant/round evidence and policy; Phase15 supplies Personal Taste/setup;
  Phase16.3 completes joint responses/history and controlled rewatch before beta.
- Multi-destination List selection, final Add without a second Done action,
  always-available unknown Taste response, approximately ten movies then ten books,
  link reveal/copy and device details remain in their canonical product docs.
- #230 private statistics/weekly tracking and #231 multi-select/history trash are
  now required pre-MVP Phase 17.0 work. #239 card controls and #240 reconnect
  recovery join them; FUT-UX-003 joint-list choice remains a separate candidate.
- Then follow ROADMAP: algorithm/catalog/engine foundation → Taste/holdout →
  anonymous web/app + Google/Apple continuity → preview → Friend/safety → explicit
  Shared creation and joint rounds → core UX/telemetry/privacy → complete beta →
  production/stores → owner-accepted Share Link Gate.

The owner reports exercised device flows working, but no exact installed APK
identity/timings were provided for the latest feedback. Empty/fresh-account
acceptance remains untested. Preserve current test history; a future small-group
reset is not an instruction to reset now. Do not dispatch or poll APKs as a
substitute for the next source unit.

## Hygiene and remaining findings

The [2026-09-12 audit](retros/2026-09-12.md) records scope, checks and limits.
Proven-unused catalog hook/wrapper removed; accepted-main migration protection
extends from 47 to 50 exact hashes without changing SQL or the baseline cutoff.
Raw/fitted research paths are ignored before the first dataset operation.
The compatible js-yaml 4.3.2 lockfile patch removes the high advisory. Fresh audit
has no high/critical findings and fifteen moderate package entries across three
advisories; #238 prioritizes the runtime routing decoder before public links and
coordinates build/test-tool updates. Do not apply an incompatible bare override.

Open source findings are assigned to their existing work owners:
#228 configured protocol-2 device/recovery acceptance; #182 Edge catalog configuration
and dependency/entrypoint verification; #160 / MVP-OPS-005 production configuration,
password endpoint input/abuse policy and release dependency checks. See the audit
for dependency findings and exact verification; no hosted security conclusion is inferred.

Merged `feat/226-atomic-collection-actions` is byte-equivalent to accepted #227
and safe to retire. Remote branch deletion is unavailable through this session's
supported GitHub capability; do not repeat the completed 145-branch historical
cleanup or remove the active #229 branch. After #234 merge, its documentation
branch can likewise be retired through a supported operation.

Sprint014, full DATA/ALG/ENG acceptance, device gates and public release remain open.
