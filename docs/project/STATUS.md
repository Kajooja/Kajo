# Kajo Current Status

Last updated: **2026-09-13**
Current milestone: **MVP 0.1 — first public Kajo**
Current sprint: **Sprint 014 — algorithm reliability / real catalog / portable engine**
Last accepted sprint: **Sprint 013 — Prediction Nervous System & ScenarioMemory**

This file owns one exact resumable next task. [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) owns order,
[MVP](../product/MVP.md) owns release blockers and [LAUNCH_LOOP](../product/LAUNCH_LOOP.md)
owns the Taste/Friend/Shared flow. Read current main first, then the active branch;
an older branch-local handoff cannot replace newer accepted product decisions.

## Current hosted packet — #182 canary accepted; catalog expansion next

**The authorized one-page TMDB canary is complete and independently verified.**
At **2026-09-13 11:03:06 UTC**, the owner's successful Test response reported
`importedCount: 20`, `skippedCount: 0`, `pages: [1]`, `language: fi-FI`,
`region: FI` and `minimumVoteCount: 40`. The existing CLI response validator
accepts the exact supplied body. Read-only database checks confirm all 20 TMDB
sources synced at `2026-09-13T11:03:06.083766Z` and map to 20 distinct Items with
matching TMDB and IMDb aliases. **Do not repeat the canary or request its result.**

Discoverable MOVIE inventory increased **30 → 49**, and stored MOVIE rows
**42 → 61**. Nineteen Items are new; TMDB `278` / IMDb `tt0111161` enriched the
existing curated *Rita Hayworth - avain pakoon* Item while retaining its earlier
creation time and curated source. All 20 TMDB Items have title, description,
poster, creators, year, original language, normalized tags, runtime, vote count
and popularity. All 20 poster URLs returned HTTP 200 / `image/jpeg`. There are
zero missing matching TMDB/IMDb aliases and zero discoverable mocks. BOOK stays
at 415 discoverable / 427 stored, with 385 images and no descriptions. Batch RPC
EXECUTE remains false for anon/authenticated and true for service_role.

The [accepted canary checkpoint](sprints/SPRINT-014.md#tmdb-one-page-canary-accepted--2026-09-13--182)
records the response, before/after inventory, deduplication, metadata/CDN checks,
evidence limits and proposed continuation. The first page contains 20 original
English-language films, 17 from 2026. Finnish and English fallback descriptions
are both present; `language: fi-FI` localizes metadata and does not establish a
Finnish-content mix. Twenty MOVIE Items have images/descriptions; 29 remaining
curated movies do not. This proves the provider path, not beta breadth or native
image-rendering/quality acceptance. `MVP-CAT-001..003` and #182 remain open.

**Next bounded task: prepare and review #182 catalog expansion with explicit
breadth, diversity and remaining-metadata targets.** Read the latest
[Issue #182](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/182) checkpoint before executing
another import. An actual CLI dry-run starting at page 2, covering 14 pages in
max-three-page requests, produces batches 2–4, 5–7, 8–10, 11–13 and 14–15.
It is a reviewed transport proposal, not a completed expansion or a diversity
plan. Specify genre/year/original-language coverage and enrichment of the remaining
29 curated MOVIE Items, then run the selected bounded batches with before/after
coverage and stop-on-error behavior. Do not assume a popularity-sorted page range
alone meets the Finnish/international diversity requirement or promises a fixed
unique Item count. Source/control improvements needed for that plan can proceed
without secret access; a further hosted import uses an authorized admin environment
or the working owner Test view.

The existing configuration, Default-key preflight and provider token have now
worked through the actual provider and privileged Data API path. No new key,
rotation, settings/presence check, private log or browser sign-in is needed.
PR #248 is the accepted runtime repair on `bd7a23f776e99b452404fef0393155b62d96ade0`;
all five CI #488 jobs, 377 local tests and 15 staged catalog cases passed.
PR #249 accepted the earlier preflight handoff on
`395b0bf222000377cd04322436e6f398e5f8c1e2` after all five CI #490 jobs passed.
Fresh ACTIVE v9 readback still matches all three accepted source files exactly,
with `verify_jwt=false` and the local import map; no new deployment was needed.
Issue #182 owns this documentation packet's later merge/CI checkpoint.

The owner authorized completing the catalog repair/rollout and one-page canary,
then requested a resumable repository handoff. This bounded unit is complete;
retain the demonstrated exact-key boundary and do not restore floating v2 code.
E1/D1/D2 stay accepted, with the rejected challenger research-only. #229 retains
its native/device/fresh-account gates and six installed immutable forwards.
Do not redeploy those forwards or reset accounts. Optional research, APK work
and #240/UI work do not replace the named catalog continuation; the owner UI
ideas remain required before MVP. No phase or public-release gate is closed here.

## Accepted D2 development comparison

The owner-authorized GroupLens Latest Small September 2018 / Kaggle v2 source
supplies 500 subjects and 84,849 complete-history ratings. D2 compared eight
variants with frozen chronological/held-out-subject partitions and independent
reproduction. Validation's 0.001959 RMSE gain missed the predeclared 0.01 admission
gate: challenger admission is rejected and native use deferred. Separate prequential
results do not prove fixed-holdout or native usefulness; cold-start support is limited.
[The readable report](../../research/reports/movielens-small-d2.md),
[aggregate evidence](../../research/reports/movielens-small-d2.json) and
[D2 checkpoint](sprints/SPRINT-014-D2.md) retain exact hashes, partitions, all metrics,
uncertainty, costs, reproduction/review history and the 357-test source acceptance.
Raw histories, fitted models and predictions remain ignored and research-only.

## Native packet checkpoint — #228 / draft PR #229

`feat/228-delivered-origin` remains the native source/rollout record. CI #468 and
manual [CI #469](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/actions/runs/34701247895) passed
at `900dc2653e428bb1cbd27e4bdaa7ea0141e47b31`. The manual run produced
`kajo-android-standalone-900dc2653e428bb1cbd27e4bdaa7ea0141e47b31`
(artifact `10300513895`). The owner report follows this requested build;
the installed binary checksum was not independently supplied.

Owner feedback accepts the exercised normal flows, Profile switching, expired
cursor → fresh search and the reported persistence/restart checks. Record this
as device feedback, not proof of every server attribution/native callback race.
The remaining reconnect defect is [#240](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/240)
/ MVP-UX-003: recover the same failed request on usable reconnection and remove
stale retry UI after successful recovery. Do not merely hide a failed backend
response because the device says online. The owner explicitly defers this to the
next application UI packet; do not silently substitute it for the named source packet.

The six approved server forwards remain installed through
`20260912134224_atomic_prediction_pages`. Do not deploy them again or repeat the
approval. The 15-second client deadline, exact retry/cancel semantics and all
439 local tests remain recorded in [the native recovery checkpoint](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/blob/feat/228-delivered-origin/docs/project/sprints/SPRINT-014.md#bounded-client-recovery--2026-09-12).
No fresh-account test/reset, new DDL, automatic promotion or full DATA/ALG closure
is implied. Keep #229 draft while its named acceptance gaps remain; E1 is an
independent source packet, not a way to mark those gaps complete.

## Owner UI decisions — required before MVP

ROADMAP Phase 17.0 now requires private category statistics/progress and weekly
tracking (#230 / MVP-UX-004), grid multi-selection and List/history operations
(#231 / MVP-UX-005), plus the new card controls (#239 / MVP-UX-006). The star saves
to the existing default List shown as **Tykätyt**; the header's three-dot menu opens
other destinations. Slider and **Ei kiinnosta / Seuraava** sit at the bottom of the
card above the dock, leaving space for a description. Saving stays on the card;
**Seuraava** explicitly advances. UX_PRINCIPLES owns this planned successor to
current auto-advance, with unchanged evidence and Shared consent semantics.
Community comparisons remain conditional. Implementation is planned, not shipped.

## Accepted source, active branch and recorded hosted state

Accepted runtime source at audit start: `6dd1fec` / PR #227 — atomic/durable Item,
List and Shared action foundations. #227 is merged; do not repeat its deployment.
The #233/#234 delivery publishes independent-engine direction and reconciled
product/handoff documentation, plus bounded repository hygiene. It does not
accept #229 runtime, implement a portable engine or train a model.

#229 contains later source work: delivered-slate identity, durable exposure,
multi-List/collection UX, history projection, late outcomes, frozen replay,
eligibility-first admission, identified first pages, private source windows and
protocol-2 atomic continuation and the captured-scope mobile reader.
The branch has source/test/rollout evidence that must remain intact. Its detailed
device and implementation records stay on that branch/PR until accepted; compact
canonical successor contracts in main are explicitly labeled.

The owner-approved #229 hosted rollout completed on 2026-09-12 through
`20260912134224_atomic_prediction_pages`, as recorded in that branch's
[rollout checkpoint](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/blob/feat/228-delivered-origin/docs/project/sprints/SPRINT-014.md#approved-hosted-prediction-rollout--2026-09-12).
All six installed forwards are immutable; do not redeploy, reset, repair historical
migrations or mistake this older accepted-main SQL tree for a new rollout packet.
The separately deferred `20260909131913_close_postgres_function_defaults.sql`
remains its own gate. This independent E1 packet ran no hosted query or mutation.

The private window bounds remain 50 candidates/seen IDs, 2 MiB, fifteen minutes
from source ranking and sixteen windows per actor/Profile. Preserve receipts,
runs and Events when reclaiming expired derived cache.

## Independent engine and when public data enters

Canonical design: [PREDICTIVE_MEMORY_ENGINE](../architecture/PREDICTIVE_MEMORY_ENGINE.md),
[DATA_ENRICHMENT](../architecture/DATA_ENRICHMENT.md) and
[ADR-0008](../architecture/decisions/0008-portable-predictive-memory-engine-and-external-priors.md).
All 51 supplied conceptual sections are preserved. The core is independent; Kajo
is its first DomainAdapter.

The ordered engine work is:

| Packet | Exact deliverable | Starts after |
|---|---|---|
| [E1 #235](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/235) | Runnable generic contracts + Kajo/media and synthetic non-media fixtures; workspace/exports/root CI integration | Accepted design; explicitly selected after owner device feedback |
| [D1 #236](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/236) | Isolated manifest, MovieLens adapter and actual reproducible small real-data cohort | E1 contract acceptance |
| [D2 #237](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/237) | Train-only temporal/cold-start baselines and bounded static-state vs trajectory experiment/report | D1 normalized data |
| D3 / D4 / D5 | Optional Tag Genome / Beliefs / KuaiRand studies | D2 plus each source's own manifest/rights/task; independent of each other |
| E2 | One admitted component behind existing serving boundary | Relevant native 14.1/14.2 gates + rights/quality/compatibility/fallback/rollback |

E1, D1 and D2 are accepted through #241/#242/#243. The reproducible D2 report
and rejection/fallback decision are complete; continue the named #182 catalog unit. #229 retains native
acceptance and application UI work remains in its separately ordered packet. No large native user
population, production schema or separate network service is needed for D1.

Use ignored `research-data/` and `research-artifacts/` or equivalent controlled
storage. External ratings are source-typed observations, not fake native Events
or fully observed behavioral Scenarios. Public catalog enrichment and a real
user's authorized history import remain separate pipelines. Data download,
normalization, model training, evaluation and artifact admission are distinct
recorded operations. A losing challenger is a valid report; it cannot waive
native usefulness gates or deploy itself.

E1 delivered executable contracts; D1 delivered real research intake; D2 now
fits and evaluates bounded offline models. Fitted artifacts remain research-only
and are rejected for admission in this configuration. No native model integration,
world model, multistep dreamer or automatic promotion is delivered.

## Preserved owner requirements and release order

- #232 is mandatory first-release Shared rating/rewatch behavior: Phase14 supplies
  participant/round evidence and policy; Phase15 supplies Personal Taste/setup;
  Phase16.3 completes joint responses/history and controlled rewatch before beta.
- Multi-destination List selection, final Add without a second Done action,
  always-available unknown Taste response, approximately ten movies then ten books,
  link reveal/copy and device details remain in their canonical product docs.
- #230 private statistics/weekly tracking and #231 multi-select/history trash are
  now required pre-MVP Phase 17.0 work. #239 card controls and #240 reconnect
  recovery join them; FUT-UX-003 joint-list choice remains a separate candidate.
- Then follow ROADMAP: algorithm/catalog/engine foundation → Taste/holdout →
  anonymous web/app + Google/Apple continuity → preview → Friend/safety → explicit
  Shared creation and joint rounds → core UX/telemetry/privacy → complete beta →
  production/stores → owner-accepted Share Link Gate.

The owner reports exercised device flows working, but no exact installed APK
identity/timings were provided for the latest feedback. Empty/fresh-account
acceptance remains untested. Preserve current test history; a future small-group
reset is not an instruction to reset now. Do not dispatch or poll APKs as a
substitute for the next source unit.

## Hygiene and remaining findings

The [2026-09-12 audit](retros/2026-09-12.md) records scope, checks and limits.
Proven-unused catalog hook/wrapper removed; accepted-main migration protection
extends from 47 to 50 exact hashes without changing SQL or the baseline cutoff.
Raw/fitted research paths are ignored before the first dataset operation.
The compatible js-yaml 4.3.2 lockfile patch removes the high advisory. Fresh audit
has no high/critical findings and fifteen moderate package entries across three
advisories; #238 prioritizes the runtime routing decoder before public links and
coordinates build/test-tool updates. Do not apply an incompatible bare override.

Open source findings are assigned to their existing work owners:
#228 configured protocol-2 device/recovery acceptance; #182 catalog breadth/diversity
and metadata expansion after the accepted provider canary; #160 / MVP-OPS-005 production configuration,
password endpoint input/abuse policy and release dependency checks. See the audit
for dependency findings and exact verification; no hosted security conclusion is inferred.

Merged `feat/226-atomic-collection-actions` is byte-equivalent to accepted #227
and safe to retire. Remote branch deletion is unavailable through this session's
supported GitHub capability; do not repeat the completed 145-branch historical
cleanup or remove the active #229 branch. After #234 merge, its documentation
branch can likewise be retired through a supported operation.

Sprint014, full DATA/ALG/ENG acceptance, device gates and public release remain open.
