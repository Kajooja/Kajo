# Kajo Current Status

Last updated: **2026-09-12**
Current milestone: **MVP 0.1 — first public Kajo**
Current sprint: **Sprint 014 — algorithm reliability / real catalog / portable engine**
Last accepted sprint: **Sprint 013 — Prediction Nervous System & ScenarioMemory**

This file owns one exact resumable next task. [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) owns order,
[MVP](../product/MVP.md) owns release blockers and [LAUNCH_LOOP](../product/LAUNCH_LOOP.md)
owns the Taste/Friend/Shared flow. Read current main first, then the active branch;
an older branch-local handoff cannot replace newer accepted product decisions.

## Current source packet — D1 #236, real development seed

**Continue [D1 #236](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/236) on
`feat/236-movielens-research` / [PR #242](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/pull/242).**
It starts from accepted E1 main `3747ecb58d69ba78440ca1b72b7cc554b1a9720a` / #241.
MVP-ENG-001 is accepted; #229's later native runtime remains separate.

The owner explicitly authorized an available alternative to MovieLens 32M on
2026-09-12. The selected source is **GroupLens MovieLens Latest Small, September
2018, Kaggle version 2**. Its official publisher identity, archived README terms,
version, ZIP and all five member hashes have been checked. The allowed current
scope is noncommercial offline development with attribution. This is the publisher's
development dataset, not a shared benchmark or evidence of Kajo product uplift.
The original 32M TLS failure is recorded historically and no longer blocks D1.

Actual source: **100,836 ratings, 610 subjects, 9,742 movies, 3,683 tags**. The fixed
hash-selected **500-subject cohort retains 84,849 complete-history ratings**,
with 20–2,698 ratings per selected subject. All cohort ratings were converted
through the built TypeScript adapter into source-typed engine Observations.
One TMDb alias collision quarantines both mappings; no ratings were discarded
and no movie/user identities were merged. Ten objects lack usable TMDb aliases;
no IMDb alias is missing. Live Kajo catalog intersection remains unqueried.

Two independent fresh normalization/conversion runs produced identical manifests
and output hashes; a third run verified both cached stages. The engine output
SHA-256 is `2bf4213edc2e63b7fd208900342fab98d4b971a2ce9e1760c9339531cb0e9463`.
The final first/replay commands took 1.94/1.73 seconds; largest measured child RSS
was 132,268 KiB (not a simultaneous process-tree peak). Source download is separate:
an initial inspection and a second authored download returned the same 993,937-byte
archive. [Aggregate evidence](../../research/reports/movielens-small-v2-intake.json)
contains exact commands, every hash, scope and resource-measure limitations.

Real data exposed a vacuous prefix probe when the first twenty ratings shared a
timestamp. The corrected bounded probe waits for a strictly later group; all-tied
histories are reported unsupported. The real probe now used twenty earlier records
and excluded the complete target timestamp group. This is contract evidence,
not a quality metric or model training.

Local `EXPO_OFFLINE=1 CI=1 npm run check` passed **345 tests** (212 mobile,
14 catalog, 61 database, 35 engine, 19 Python intake and four pipeline cases),
lint/TypeScript and both Hermes exports. The existing mobile Hook warning remains.
All five required jobs passed in CI #473/#474 for the preceding source/metadata
heads; this new source head needs its own required CI before merge. See
[the D1 checkpoint](sprints/SPRINT-014-D1.md) and [commands](../../research/README.md).

**Next bounded task: accept this real-data/source packet after current-head CI,
then continue D2 #237 with the pinned small-development cohort.** Freeze global
chronological and held-out-subject splits, source/code hashes, seeds, metrics,
resource budgets and baseline/ordered-prefix comparisons before any fitting.
Do not resume unchanged 32M download loops as a prerequisite. Larger stable data
can be verified separately when useful; source, research and native admission
remain distinct. No fitted model, hosted write or UI change is delivered here.

## Native packet checkpoint — #228 / draft PR #229

`feat/228-delivered-origin` remains the native source/rollout record. CI #468 and
manual [CI #469](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/actions/runs/34701247895) passed
at `900dc2653e428bb1cbd27e4bdaa7ea0141e47b31`. The manual run produced
`kajo-android-standalone-900dc2653e428bb1cbd27e4bdaa7ea0141e47b31`
(artifact `10300513895`). The owner report follows this requested build;
the installed binary checksum was not independently supplied.

Owner feedback accepts the exercised normal flows, Profile switching, expired
cursor → fresh search and the reported persistence/restart checks. Record this
as device feedback, not proof of every server attribution/native callback race.
The remaining reconnect defect is [#240](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/240)
/ MVP-UX-003: recover the same failed request on usable reconnection and remove
stale retry UI after successful recovery. Do not merely hide a failed backend
response because the device says online. The owner explicitly defers this to the
next application UI packet; do not silently start it instead of E1.

The six approved server forwards remain installed through
`20260912134224_atomic_prediction_pages`. Do not deploy them again or repeat the
approval. The 15-second client deadline, exact retry/cancel semantics and all
439 local tests remain recorded in [the native recovery checkpoint](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/blob/feat/228-delivered-origin/docs/project/sprints/SPRINT-014.md#bounded-client-recovery--2026-09-12).
No fresh-account test/reset, new DDL, automatic promotion or full DATA/ALG closure
is implied. Keep #229 draft while its named acceptance gaps remain; E1 is an
independent source packet, not a way to mark those gaps complete.

## Owner UI decisions — required before MVP

ROADMAP Phase 17.0 now requires private category statistics/progress and weekly
tracking (#230 / MVP-UX-004), grid multi-selection and List/history operations
(#231 / MVP-UX-005), plus the new card controls (#239 / MVP-UX-006). The star saves
to the existing default List shown as **Tykätyt**; the header's three-dot menu opens
other destinations. Slider and **Ei kiinnosta / Seuraava** sit at the bottom of the
card above the dock, leaving space for a description. Saving stays on the card;
**Seuraava** explicitly advances. UX_PRINCIPLES owns this planned successor to
current auto-advance, with unchanged evidence and Shared consent semantics.
Community comparisons remain conditional. Implementation is planned, not shipped.

## Accepted source, active branch and recorded hosted state

Accepted runtime source at audit start: `6dd1fec` / PR #227 — atomic/durable Item,
List and Shared action foundations. #227 is merged; do not repeat its deployment.
The #233/#234 delivery publishes independent-engine direction and reconciled
product/handoff documentation, plus bounded repository hygiene. It does not
accept #229 runtime, implement a portable engine or train a model.

#229 contains later source work: delivered-slate identity, durable exposure,
multi-List/collection UX, history projection, late outcomes, frozen replay,
eligibility-first admission, identified first pages, private source windows and
protocol-2 atomic continuation and the captured-scope mobile reader.
The branch has source/test/rollout evidence that must remain intact. Its detailed
device and implementation records stay on that branch/PR until accepted; compact
canonical successor contracts in main are explicitly labeled.

The owner-approved #229 hosted rollout completed on 2026-09-12 through
`20260912134224_atomic_prediction_pages`, as recorded in that branch's
[rollout checkpoint](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/blob/feat/228-delivered-origin/docs/project/sprints/SPRINT-014.md#approved-hosted-prediction-rollout--2026-09-12).
All six installed forwards are immutable; do not redeploy, reset, repair historical
migrations or mistake this older accepted-main SQL tree for a new rollout packet.
The separately deferred `20260909131913_close_postgres_function_defaults.sql`
remains its own gate. This independent E1 packet ran no hosted query or mutation.

The private window bounds remain 50 candidates/seen IDs, 2 MiB, fifteen minutes
from source ranking and sixteen windows per actor/Profile. Preserve receipts,
runs and Events when reclaiming expired derived cache.

## Independent engine and when public data enters

Canonical design: [PREDICTIVE_MEMORY_ENGINE](../architecture/PREDICTIVE_MEMORY_ENGINE.md),
[DATA_ENRICHMENT](../architecture/DATA_ENRICHMENT.md) and
[ADR-0008](../architecture/decisions/0008-portable-predictive-memory-engine-and-external-priors.md).
All 51 supplied conceptual sections are preserved. The core is independent; Kajo
is its first DomainAdapter.

The ordered engine work is:

| Packet | Exact deliverable | Starts after |
|---|---|---|
| [E1 #235](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/235) | Runnable generic contracts + Kajo/media and synthetic non-media fixtures; workspace/exports/root CI integration | Accepted design; explicitly selected after owner device feedback |
| [D1 #236](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/236) | Isolated manifest, MovieLens adapter and actual reproducible small real-data cohort | E1 contract acceptance |
| [D2 #237](https://github.com/Kajooja/Kajo/issues/237) | Train-only temporal/cold-start baselines and bounded static-state vs trajectory experiment/report | D1 normalized data |
| D3 / D4 / D5 | Optional Tag Genome / Beliefs / KuaiRand studies | D2 plus each source's own manifest/rights/task; independent of each other |
| E2 | One admitted component behind existing serving boundary | Relevant native 14.1/14.2 gates + rights/quality/compatibility/fallback/rollback |

E1 is accepted through #241, and D1 is the current isolated source packet while
#229 retains its remaining native acceptance. Complete D1 source acceptance and then run the declared D2 development experiment;
keep application UI work in its separately ordered packet. No large native user
population, production schema or separate network service is needed for D1.

Use ignored `research-data/` and `research-artifacts/` or equivalent controlled
storage. External ratings are source-typed observations, not fake native Events
or fully observed behavioral Scenarios. Public catalog enrichment and a real
user's authorized history import remain separate pipelines. Data download,
normalization, model training, evaluation and artifact admission are distinct
recorded operations. A losing challenger is a valid report; it cannot waive
native usefulness gates or deploy itself.

E1 delivered executable contracts and transparent fixture computation. D1 adds
research intake; actual data acceptance is recorded above. No trained model,
world model, multistep dreamer or automatic promotion is delivered.

## Preserved owner requirements and release order

- #232 is mandatory first-release Shared rating/rewatch behavior: Phase14 supplies
  participant/round evidence and policy; Phase15 supplies Personal Taste/setup;
  Phase16.3 completes joint responses/history and controlled rewatch before beta.
- Multi-destination List selection, final Add without a second Done action,
  always-available unknown Taste response, approximately ten movies then ten books,
  link reveal/copy and device details remain in their canonical product docs.
- #230 private statistics/weekly tracking and #231 multi-select/history trash are
  now required pre-MVP Phase 17.0 work. #239 card controls and #240 reconnect
  recovery join them; FUT-UX-003 joint-list choice remains a separate candidate.
- Then follow ROADMAP: algorithm/catalog/engine foundation → Taste/holdout →
  anonymous web/app + Google/Apple continuity → preview → Friend/safety → explicit
  Shared creation and joint rounds → core UX/telemetry/privacy → complete beta →
  production/stores → owner-accepted Share Link Gate.

The owner reports exercised device flows working, but no exact installed APK
identity/timings were provided for the latest feedback. Empty/fresh-account
acceptance remains untested. Preserve current test history; a future small-group
reset is not an instruction to reset now. Do not dispatch or poll APKs as a
substitute for the next source unit.

## Hygiene and remaining findings

The [2026-09-12 audit](retros/2026-09-12.md) records scope, checks and limits.
Proven-unused catalog hook/wrapper removed; accepted-main migration protection
extends from 47 to 50 exact hashes without changing SQL or the baseline cutoff.
Raw/fitted research paths are ignored before the first dataset operation.
The compatible js-yaml 4.3.2 lockfile patch removes the high advisory. Fresh audit
has no high/critical findings and fifteen moderate package entries across three
advisories; #238 prioritizes the runtime routing decoder before public links and
coordinates build/test-tool updates. Do not apply an incompatible bare override.

Open source findings are assigned to their existing work owners:
#228 configured protocol-2 device/recovery acceptance; #182 Edge catalog configuration
and dependency/entrypoint verification; #160 / MVP-OPS-005 production configuration,
password endpoint input/abuse policy and release dependency checks. See the audit
for dependency findings and exact verification; no hosted security conclusion is inferred.

Merged `feat/226-atomic-collection-actions` is byte-equivalent to accepted #227
and safe to retire. Remote branch deletion is unavailable through this session's
supported GitHub capability; do not repeat the completed 145-branch historical
cleanup or remove the active #229 branch. After #234 merge, its documentation
branch can likewise be retired through a supported operation.

Sprint014, full DATA/ALG/ENG acceptance, device gates and public release remain open.
